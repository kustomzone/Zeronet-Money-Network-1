# Zeronet-Money-Network
Demo with complementary and alternative money. Implemented in ZeroFrame and AngularJS. Focus on privacy, encryption, max data on client and min data on server. 

Alternative and complementary money systems can in greater or less extent, replace or support the current monetary system and 
prevent some bad things from happening in the future. There exists many alternative and complementary money systems, but they are not as 
accessible and real for people as good old conventional money. 

The primary goal of the Money Network is to make complementary and alternative monetary systems just as real and accessible as 
regular conventional money. One client wallet for it all.

## Project status
Spare time project, work in progress, no money in here yet. For now just a chat app on a very promising platform (ZeroNet). 

Implemented:
- End-2-end encryption. Data in localStorage and on ZeroNet is encrypted. Only search tags and public chat are stored in clear on ZeroNet. 
- Contact list: Categories: new, guest, unverified, verified and ignored.
- Chat: One and two panel chat, encrypted personal and group chat & unencrypted public chat.

Todo:
- Chat. More social network like UI. Add comments. Follow and unfollow public chat. Endless scroll
- Wallet, Money API and interface to external money systems.  

## Demo
- http://127.0.0.1:43110/moneynetwork.bit/ ([ZeroNet](https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_zeronet/installing/) required)
- https://bit.no.com:43110/moneynetwork.bit/ (proxy)

This demo should be safe to check out on a ZeroNet proxy server. 
You can see all ZeroNet sites on proxy servers but do not use your normal ZeroNet cert on a ZeroNet proxy server.

## Software 
- html5, ccs3, javascript and some sql. Simple code, lots of comments and code should be "easy"" to follow. 
- [AngularJS v1.5.8](https://angularjs.org/) (very well documented).
- [ZeroNet 5.0](https://zeronet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/site_development/zeroframe_api_reference/) (documentation could be better).
- Test: for now no testing framework. Just testing manually.

## Help
Test help would by nice. Create an issue if you find something that should be fixed.

Ideas and inspiration are welcome. Specially on wallet and money API parts that have not yet been started. Fell free to create an issue with your inputs,
